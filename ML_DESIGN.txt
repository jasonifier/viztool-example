NER involves the identification of key information in the text and classification into a set of predefined categories.

At its core, NLP is just a two-step process, below are the two steps that are involved:

 - Detecting the entities from the text
 - Classifying them into different categories

System algorithm:

1. analyses the entire input text to identify and locate the named entities
2. identifies the sentence (context) boundaries by considering capitalization rules
3. trained to classify entire documents into different types, such as invoices, receipts, or passports
4. employs machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, to analyze labeled datasets
5. multiple training iterations, the model refines its understanding of contextual features, syntactic structures, and entity patterns, continuously improving its accuracy over time
